# Map、Food、Smiles

## 📍 Map
First, let's start with map. I was raised in Banqiao, New Taipei City, and I think the most famous landmark in my hometown is New Taipei Christmasland. I also studied at National Chung Cheng University in Chiayi, where I spent my university years on a peaceful campus surrounded by nature.

## 🍣 Food
Next, we have food. I love sashimi, because of its simplicity and rich flavor. I appreciate things that are straightforward yet meaningful. Another dish I love is sukiyaki, a Japanese hot pot, the moment the beef absorbs the umami flavors of the broth and is dipped into raw egg, it becomes incredibly flavorful. Lastly, I enjoy spaghetti, especially white wine clam spaghetti, because the aroma of garlic and olive oil makes the dish even more irresistible.

## 😊 Smiles
Finally, we come to smiles, the things that bring me the most joy. Traveling makes me smile because I love experiencing different cultures, trying local foods, and discovering new places, and playing basketball is another passion of mine, and it's a good way to relieve stress.
